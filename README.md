Hey there!  
In this repo I'll upload my Java solutions for various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems that I solve while practicing.  
The problems will be from different topics .  

ðŸ“Œ **What you'll find here:**
- Java solutions for a wide range of DSA problems
- Clean and readable code with comments
- Organized folder structure based on problem type

ðŸš€ **Why Iâ€™m doing this:**
Iâ€™m solving DSA problems regularly to strengthen my problem-solving skills, prepare for coding interviews, and improve my coding style.

ðŸ›  **Tech stack:**
- Language: Java 17
- IDE: Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA

ðŸ’¡ **Note:**  
This repo will be continuously updated as I solve more problems. Stay tuned!
